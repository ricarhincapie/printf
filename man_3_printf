SYNOPSIS
--------
#include "holberton.h"
 
DESCRIPTION
-----------
_printf is a function for data output on screen according to a pre-established format described below

c - Allows us to print character by character

examples:
 
entry ---> _printf ("Character: [% c] \ n", 'H');
autput ---> Character: [H]

s - It allows us to print a whole line of characters

entry ---> _printf ("String: [% s] \ n", "I am a string!");
output ---> String: [I am a string!]

d and i - These two formats allow us to show integers on the screen

examples:

entry ---> _printf ("Negative: [% d] \ n", -762534);
output ---> Negative: [- 762534]

% - This percentage is used to identify the pre-established formats which must necessarily be before the type of format that is required.

examples:

% c - used for character
% i - used for integer
% s - used for string

In this previous order, the data type formats to be printed on the screen are handled.

RETURN VALUE

Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
